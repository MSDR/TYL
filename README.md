# TYL

TYL - A grid-based puzzle game in development for the Rensselaer Game Showcase 2019, all about pattern recognition and functional problem solving.      

To play, all you need to download is the Game folder, then run the .exe within.
I encourage you to work your way down the list of puzzles, trying each one and exploring the quirks of each operator. Have fun!
